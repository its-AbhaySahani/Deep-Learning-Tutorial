were	4
proud	5
to	2
say	3
that	4
they	4
were	4
perfectly	9
normal	6
thank	5
you	3
very	4
much	4
They	4
were	4
the	3
last	4
people	6

â	1
â	1
d	1
expect	6
to	2
be	2
involved	8
in	2
anything	8
strange	7
or	2
mysterious	10
because	7
they	4
just	4
didnÃ	5
â	1
â	1
t	1
hold	4
with	4
such	4
nonsense	8
Mr	2
Dursley	7
was	3
the	3
director	8
of	2
a	1
firm	4
called	6
Grunnings	9
which	5
made	4
drills	6
He	2
was	3
a	1
big	3
beefy	5
man	3
with	4
hardly	6
any	3
neck	4
although	8
he	2
did	3
have	4
a	1
very	4
large	5
mustache	8
Mrs	3
Dursley	7
was	3
thin	4
and	3
blonde	6
and	3
had	3
nearly	6
twice	5
the	3
usual	5
amount	6
of	2
neck	4
which	5
came	4
in	2
very	4
useful	6
as	2
she	3
spent	5
so	2
much	4
of	2
her	3
time	4
craning	7
over	4
garden	6
fences	6
spying	6
on	2
the	3
neighbors	9
The	3
Dursleys	8
had	3
a	1
small	5
son	3
called	6
Dudley	6
and	3
in	2
their	5
opinion	7
there	5
was	3
no	2
finer	5
boy	3
anywhere	8
The	3
Dursleys	8
had	3
everything	10
they	4
wanted	6
but	3
they	4
also	4
had	3
a	1
secret	6
and	3
their	5
greatest	8
fear	4
was	3
that	4
somebody	8
would	5
discover	8
it	2
They	4
didnÃ	5
â	1
â	1
t	1
think	5
they	4
could	5
bear	4
it	2
if	2
anyone	6
found	5
out	3
about	5
the	3
Potters	7
Mrs	3
Potter	6
was	3
Mrs	3
DursleyÃ	8
â	1

but	3
they	4
hadnÃ	5
â	1
â	1
t	1
met	3
for	3
several	7
years	5
in	2
fact	4
Mrs	3
Dursley	7
pretended	9
she	3
didnÃ	5
â	1
â	1
t	1
have	4
a	1
sister	6
because	7
her	3
sister	6
and	3
her	3
good	4
for	3
nothing	7
husband	7
were	4
as	2
unDursleyish	12
as	2
it	2
was	3
possible	8
to	2
be	2
The	3
Dursleys	8
shuddered	9
to	2
think	5
what	4
the	3
neighbors	9
would	5
say	3
if	2
the	3
Potters	7
arrived	7
in	2
the	3
street	6
The	3
Dursleys	8
knew	4
that	4
the	3
Potters	7
had	3
a	1
small	5
son	3
too	3
but	3
they	4
had	3
never	5
even	4
seen	4
him	3
This	4
boy	3
was	3
another	7
good	4
reason	6
for	3
keeping	7
the	3
Potters	7
away	4
they	4
didnÃ	5

nothing	7
about	5

that	4
strange	7
and	3
mysterious	10
things	6
would	5
soon	4
be	2
happening	9
all	3
over	4
the	3
country	7
Mr	2
Dursley	7
hummed	6
as	2
he	2
picked	6
out	3
his	3
most	4
boring	6
tie	3
for	3
work	4
and	3
Mrs	3
Dursley	7
gossiped	8
away	4
happily	7
as	2
she	3
wrestled	8
a	1
screaming	9
Dudley	6
into	4
his	3
high	4
chair	5
None	4
of	2

At	2

on	2
the	3
cheek	5
and	3
tried	5
to	2
kiss	4
Dudley	6
good	4

Ã	1
â	1
â	1
a	1

For	3

Ã	1

then	4

jerked	6
his	3

around	6
to	2

again	5
There	5

a	1
tabby	5

standing	8
on	2

Mr	2
Dursley	7
blinked	7
and	3
stared	6
at	2
the	3

It	2
stared	6
back	4
As	2
Mr	2
Dursley	7
drove	5
around	6
the	3
corner	6
and	3
up	2
the	3
road	4
he	2
watched	7

Mr	2
Dursley	7
gave	4
himself	7
a	1
little	6
shake	5
and	3
put	3
the	3
cat	3
out	3
of	2
his	3
mind	4
As	2
he	2
drove	5
toward	6
town	4
he	2
thought	7
of	2
nothing	7
except	6
a	1
large	5
order	5
of	2
drills	6
he	2
was	3
hoping	6
to	2
get	3
that	4
day	3
But	3
on	2
the	3
edge	4
of	2
town	4
drills	6
were	4
driven	6
out	3
of	2
his	3
mind	4
by	2
something	9
else	4
As	2
he	2
sat	3
in	2
the	3
usual	5
morning	7
traffic	7
jam	3
he	2
couldnÃ	7
â	1
â	1
t	1
help	4
noticing	8
that	4
there	5
seemed	6
to	2
be	2
a	1
lot	3
of	2
strangely	9
dressed	7
people	6
about	5
People	6

He	2
drummed	7
his	3
fingers	7
on	2
the	3
steering	8
wheel	5
and	3
his	3
eyes	4
fell	4
on	2
a	1
huddle	6
of	2
these	5
weirdos	7
standing	8
quite	5
close	5
by	2
They	4
were	4
whispering	10
excitedly	9
together	8
Mr	2
Dursley	7
was	3
enraged	7
to	2
see	3
that	4
a	1
couple	6
of	2
them	4
werenÃ	6
â	1
â	1
t	1

green	5
cloak	5
The	3
nerve	5
of	2
him	3
But	3
then	4
it	2
struck	6
Mr	2
Dursley	7
that	4
this	4
was	3
probably	8
some	4
silly	5
stunt	5
Ã	1
â	1

the	3

on	2
the	3

was	3
showing	7
no	2
sign	4
of	2
sleepiness	10
It	2
was	3
sitting	7

Nothing	7

ever	4
been	4
seen	4
on	2
Privet	6

He	2
was	3
tall	4
thin	4
and	3
very	4
old	3
judging	7
by	2
the	3
silver	6
of	2
his	3
hair	4
and	3
beard	5
which	5
were	4
both	4
long	4
enough	6
to	2
tuck	4
into	4
his	3
belt	4
He	2
was	3
wearing	7
long	4
robes	5
a	1
purple	6
cloak	5
that	4
swept	5
the	3
ground	6
and	3
high	4
heeled	6
buckled	7

His	3
blue	4
eyes	4
were	4
light	5
bright	6
and	3
sparkling	9
behind	6
half	4
moon	4
spectacles	10
and	3
his	3
nose	4
was	3
very	4
long	4
and	3
crooked	7
as	2
though	6
it	2
had	3
been	4
broken	6
at	2

He	2
was	3

looking	7
for	3
something	9
But	3
he	2
did	3
seem	4
to	2
realize	7

looked	6
up	2

which	5
was	3

staring	7
at	2

from	4

For	3
some	4

put	3
them	4

Harry	5
was	3
used	4
to	2
spiders	7
because	7
the	3
cupboard	8
under	5
the	3
stairs	6
was	3
full	4
of	2
them	4
and	3
that	4
was	3
where	5

When	4
he	2
was	3
dressed	7
he	2
went	4
down	4
the	3
hall	4
into	4

The	3
table	5
was	3
almost	6
hidden	6

wanted	6
not	3

Exactly	7
why	3
Dudley	6
wanted	6
a	1
racing	6

was	3
a	1
mystery	7
to	2
Harry	5
as	2

he	2
was	3
very	4

Perhaps	7
it	2
had	3
something	9
to	2
do	2
with	4
living	6
in	2
a	1
dark	4
cupboard	8
but	3
Harry	5
had	3
always	6
been	4
small	5
and	3
skinny	6
for	3
his	3
age	3
He	2
looked	6
even	4
smaller	7
and	3
skinnier	8
than	4
he	2
really	6
was	3
because	7
all	3
he	2
had	3
to	2
wear	4
were	4
old	3
clothes	7
of	2
DudleyÃ	7

He	2

with	4
a	1

of	2
Scotch	6

because	7
of	2
all	3
the	3
times	5
Dudley	6
had	3
punched	7
him	3
on	2
the	3

The	3
only	4
thing	5
Harry	5
liked	5
about	5
his	3
own	3
appearance	10
was	3
a	1
very	4
thin	4
scar	4
on	2
his	3
forehead	8
that	4
was	3
shaped	6

The	3

However	7
this	4
